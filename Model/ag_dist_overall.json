			"The larger food system consists of food production, processing, distribution, retailing, and cooking. However, most greenhouse gas emissions associated with the broader food system are in production: crop growing, feed production, and land use change.",

			"!Emissions from cookstoves are estimated from Bailis et al. [cookstoves] at 1.0 to 1.2 billion tons CO<sub>2</sub>e per year, and include only traditional biomass cooking fuel and not modern energy for cooking. The remaining figures are reported by Poore and Nemecek [poore].",
			"Most greenhouse gas emissions in farming and livestock are not directly associated with energy. In the United States, the larger food production uses energy as follows.",

			"With transportation a relatively minor component of the food-energy nexus, a movement toward local foods has limited potential to save on energy consumption. In some cases, localized production can increase energy consumption by requiring that food be grown in a climate that is not optimal [local_food_energy]. An exception is that air-shipped foods typically have higher lifecycle emissions than other options [food_climate]."
