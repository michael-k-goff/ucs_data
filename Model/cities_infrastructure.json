Construction market concentration|Mixed evidence?      Economies of scale (fewer highways built today increase cost)|Hard to determine?     Soft budget constraints/end of repeated game|Hard to determine?     Procurement practices|Hard to determine?      Labor laws (e.g. Davis Bacon)|Unlikely        ?Multiple layers of government|Minor effect?        Land costs|Minor effect?     Labor costs|No?      Material costs|No?     State government quality|No?     Increased use of labor (featherbedding)|No",

This means, among other things, congestion pricing, road damage pricing, variable width lanes, investing highway construction in areas where it is most needed, and safety improvements [transportation_cost]."
