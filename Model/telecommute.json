			"The impact of advancing telecommunications technology on total travel demand is complex. There there are both substition and complementary effects observed, but the evidence, both historical [salomon2][salomon] and contemporary [mokhtarian2][mokhtarian], suggests that telecommunications stimulate travel on net.",
			"Evidence suggests that telecommuting reduces total miles driven overall [telework1][telework2][telework3], but causes a rebound in the form of additional non-work driving [telework2][telework3].",
			"In the United States, about 29% of air travel [business_travel] and 23% of driving [vmt_purpose] is for work commuting and business purposes, representing the most promising opportunities for substitution with telecommunications."
