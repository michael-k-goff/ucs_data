			"A super grid is a network of high voltage direct current (HVDC) interconnections between grids to transfer power from one to another, reducing price volatility [supersmart].",
			"HVDC interconnections in the United States, including substations, cost an estimated $400 to $2700 per megawatt of capacity over a kilometer [hvdc_cost]. A fully-interconnected HVDC network in the United States, as estimated to be able to support 80% wind and solar electricity, would require 34,000 kilometers of cable with a capacity of 12 GW [shaner]. Studies in Ukraine-Romania-Moldolva [hvdc_cost2] and in Austria [hvdc_cost3] have also found that HVDC interconnections can save costs and foster renewable energy penetration relative to AC interconnections. Overbuilding and curtailing of variables sources and electricity storage are other ways to acheive this goal, but HVDC grids are likely <a href=\"/solution/energy/grid_overview\">to be cheaper</a>.",

Department of Energy, led by an appropriation from Congress, lead the construction of an HVDC grid in the United States.             @-hvdc_grid_construction.jpg-80@<b>Calculations:</b> Cost and benefit estimates are given by MacDonald et al. [hvdc_cost]; they provide figures on an annual basis and we estimate a 7% discount rate.      @Greenhouse gas reduction estimates are based on the assumption of 4000 TWh per year of total electricity in the United States; that 50% renewable energy penetration would be feasible without the HVDC grid; 80% would be feasible with it; and that the renewable energy that would be enabled by the grid would have a greenhouse gas impact of 50 grams/kWh CO<sub>2</sub>e and would displace natural gas at 450 g/kWh.      @<b>Implementation:</b> Due to the scale of a national HVDC grid, funding would likely have to be a dedicated appropriation by Congress, perhaps as part of an infrastructure bill. Development may also require revising the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to facilitate the land acquisition that will be necessary for the grid."

Microgrids can add resiliency and ancillary services to the larger grid, facilitate integration of distributed renewable energy sources such as rooftop solar, reduce line losses, and accelerate deployment of smart grid technology [microgrid].
