			"When a particular activity involving energy consumption becomes more energy efficient, some of the expected energy savings are reinvested in the good or service, or they are used elsewhere in the economy. This phenomenon is called the rebound effect. In an extreme case, the rebound can be greater than 100%.  This scenario is called backfire, or Jevons' Paradox, which means that energy efficiency actually leads to increased energy consumption. While theoretically possible, backfire probably does not occur in general [grw_rebound][stern], though is happening with <a href=\"/solution/energy/transpo_data\">information technology</a>.",
			"Based on the following survey of recent studies, a rebound of about 50% appears to happen in general. We emphasize that the values are highly uncertain.",

			"Rebound is not necessarily a bad thing or an argument against energy efficiency. From the perspective of overall welfare, consumers are better off with the rebound than without, unless the rebounded energy consumption has severe negative externalities [grw_rebound]. However, from an energy conservation or greenhouse gas reduction standpoint, the rebound effect must be taken into account."

			"While the rebound effect is well-established for energy consumption, a similar effect holds for energy production. When a clean energy source is deployed, only a portion of the new production displaces fossil fuel production, and the rest either displaces another clean energy source or induces new demand.",
