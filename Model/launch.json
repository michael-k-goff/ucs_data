			"Methane and hydrogen present engineering challenges, though methane is of particular interest since it can be synthesized on the Moon or Mars for a return trip [methane_rocket].",
			"Thermal rockets--nuclear [nasa_ntr], microwave [microwave_launch], laser [parkin_beamed], and solar [solar_thermal]--are active areas of research but are not in use today, though a solar thermal rocket is not suitable for launch from Earth. Microwave and laser thermal rockets are appealing options because they separate the energy source from the rocket. A microwave thermal rocket could achieve launch costs to low earth orbit as low as $125/kg [microwave_launch]. However, substantial research and development is still needed, and microwave and laser thermal rockets would require highly capital intensive ground facilities [microwave_launch].",
			"A spaceplane, such as the single-stage-to-orbit Skylon plane current under development [skylon], is air-breathing, thus reducing the thrust-to-weight ratio relative to rockets. However, it is not likely to be competitive in the launch market [skylon_comparison].",
			"There are many proposals for launch megastructures that use electromagnetic or mechanical lift, such as the StarTram [startram], launch loop [launchloop], orbital ring [orbital_ring], space elevator [space_elevator], and skyhook [skyhook]. Each of these concepts relies on speculative engineering and is probably not a near term option.",
			"In the near term, there are no alternatives that are likely to displace chemical rockets, though nuclear, microwave, and laser thermal rockets are promising areas for research and development."
