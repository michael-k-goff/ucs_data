Energy in cycling assumes 450 billion passenger-kilometers per year [cycling_scenario] and 1322 kilojoules primary energy oer kilometer traveled, as determined in our review of <a href=\"/solution/energy/transpo_short\">short-range transportation</a>. See our reviews of <a href=\"/solution/energy/transpo_data\">information technology</a> and <a href=\"/topic/space/space_travel\">space travel</a> for energy in those categories.

The emissions intensity of energy inputs are given by the EPA [epa_biofuel], Hanova and Dowlatabadi [hanova], Staffell [staffell], and Fridleifsson et al. [coal_intensity]. The emissions intensity of the food input energy into cycling is determined in our review of the emissions of the <a href=\"/solution/energy/ag_dist\">world food system</a>.
