'Normal' homes refer to \"a standard new construction built according to the minimal energy efficiency requirements based on the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive\" of the EU. A 'Low Energy' house is one with \"reinforced insulation and low space heating energy demand but with standard heat delivery systems\". A passive home is \"an extremely insulated and airtight passive house equipped with mechanical ventilation and a heat recovery system\"."
