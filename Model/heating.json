For electricity-based heating sources, emissions factors and primary energy are based on the average US electricity mix in 2018. The energy and environmental performance of a district heating system is highly dependent on the energy source. The primary energy estimate for district heating is based on European Union standards [lubinski] and the greenhouse gas estimate from world performance [dhc_overview].",

Though not quantified, requiring the pipe hookups for both tanked and tankless water heaters in new construction will not add much to the cost of construction, will allow future homeowners flexibility on their heating system, and will cost far less than retrofitting existing construction for new pipes.@-tankless.png-80@!The cost of requiring fixtures for both tanked and tankless water heaters would be less than 0.05% of total construction costs if done as part of the initial construction, whereas a retrofit upgrade (after construction is already complete) would be substantially more expensive, and may dissuade a homeowner from installing such a tankless water heater even if doing so might have a payback over several years.@A heat pump mandate in North Carolina would save 44.1 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year [nc_hp]."
