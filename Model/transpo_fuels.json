			"Particularly for transportation fuels, high energy density is important, as a vehicle's fuel should take as little space and weight as possible. No commonly explored option is superior to petroleum-derived fuels--gasoline and diesel--in both gravimetric (by weight) and volumetric (by volume) density, which poses a major challenge in developing alternative fuel vehicles.",
