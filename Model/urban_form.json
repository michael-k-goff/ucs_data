			"<a href=\"/solution/energy/density\">Urban density</a> is one of the most important strategies for cities to reduce their energy consumption, but it is only one piece in an integrated strategy of good urban design. Density alone--in this scenario going from single-family homes with the median American lot size to high rise urban development--can reduce vehicle-miles traveled by 29%, but an integrated strategy that uses all of the following tools may decrease VMT by 61%.",

			"It is more efficient for cities to mix land uses rather than segregate them. Going from a city with entirely segregated land uses to a city with entirely mixed land uses--the technical term is entropy--should reduce VMT by 9% [ewing_cervero]. Evidence from Arizona also shows that cities with more retail and service opportunities within walking distance of residents have less driving [az_mixed_use].",
			"Kentlands, a neighborhood of Gaithersburg, Maryland, is one of the premier examples of New Urbanist design and a partial success in achieving the efficiencies of density. Kentlands hosts a diverse housing mix, including 27% single-family detached homes, 20% townhomes, 46% multi-family, and 7% urban cottages, and has about three times the population density of Gaithersburg [texas_smart_growth]. Indicating a market demand for dense and walkable neighborhoods, homes in Kentlands sell at a premium of 13% relative to comparable homes in the region [full_circle]. While travel data is limited, Kentlands remains a highly automobile-dependent neighborhood, due in part to the failure to plan for adequate transit [texas_smart_growth].",

In 2016, cycling accounted for 27% of all trips [cycling_facts], the highest of any large country, and VMT from cycling was about 9% of VMT from driving [vmt_comparison]. The Dutch achieved high rates of cycling through separated bike lanes, bicycling parking, bike share programs, intercity bike networks, safety and liability regulations that favor cyclists, urban density, integration with public transport, and restrictions on driving. These policies have been sustained by cities and the national government since the 1970s [wardlaw].",

			"The New York and Los Angeles metropolitan areas have roughly the same overall population density (2826 and 2646 people per square mile respectively [pop_weighted]) but very different urban forms.
