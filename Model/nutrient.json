The excess flow through the terrestrial environment has an effect on species composition. Excess reactive nitrogen in the ocean can be sequestered and released as the greenhouse gas N<sub>2</sub>O, the long-term consequences of which are unclear [fowler].",

However, most known reserves are in Morocco [usgs2016], posing a risk to security of supply, and reserve estimates are in doubt [phosphate_critique].
