			"!Estimate value of ecosystem services. Values by biome are presented by Costanza et al. [costanza] in terms of dollars (2020) per hectare per year. Values by biome are gross global totals, estimated by de Groot et al. [degroot]. Valuations differ slightly between the two sources.",
			"In using ecosystem service valuation, several points need to be kept in mind. Valuations by biome are global averages across studies reported in the Ecosystem Services Partnership [esp], and even for the same biome estimates can vary widely depending on location and study methodology. Local use of habitat valuation should be based on local measurements, rather than global averages. Valuations are based on instrumental value of ecosystems for human needs and do not take into account a conservationist ethic."
