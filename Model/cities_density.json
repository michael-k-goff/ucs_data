Density, together with <a href=\"/solution/cities/urban_form\">other efficient urban designs</a>, is one of the most effective tools to save energy from <a href=\"/solution/energy/transpo_energy\">transportation</a>. Furthermore, urban density, along with agricultural intensification, is one of the few options available to reduce the human land footprint that encroaches on biodiversity. Building dense cities is especially important in the rapidly growing and urbanizing developing countries."

Figures do not account for the possibility that greater density will allow the use of <a href=\"/solution/energy/heating\">district heating and cooling systems</a>, which would bring about greater energy savings. All energy figures are primary energy in gigajoules per person per year.",

As a baseline, energy in commercial buildings is given by the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey [cbecs], with the effect of density on commercial energy consumption estimated from Masayuki [commercial_allometric]. Heating, cooling, and other residential energy is estimated from the Residential Energy Consumption Survey [recs]. Energy in residential building materials is estimated from Du et al. [chicago_embodied].

The <b>gentle density</b> scenario assumes that all population growth is accommodated by converting about 38% of today's single family homes into duplexes, small apartment buildings, or by adding ADUs. The <b>sprawl</b> scenario assumes that all population growth is accomodated by single family homes 38,000 square foot lots, resulting in a 2060 density of half today's level.",
