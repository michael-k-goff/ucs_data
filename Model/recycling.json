			"Since waste management is typically either publicly run or highly regulated, the industry might not respond efficiently to market signals. Cities can invest directly in single stream or mixed waste material recovery facilities (MRF), which collect and sort mixed waste, diverting economically useful materials for reprocessing. The combined capital, infrastructure, and operating costs for an advanced MRF has been estimated at $72 to $189 (2019 dollars) per ton of material processed [mrf2][mrf3][mrf4][kessler][mrf1][serdc]. With prices of recycled commodities <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/27/recycling-unprofitable-oil-china-dollar'>highly variable</a>, municipalities should evaluate whether investment in an advanced MRF makes sense, taking externalities into account.",
