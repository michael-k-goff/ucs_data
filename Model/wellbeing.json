			"Of great interest, in considering national economic policy, is the link between national income or GDP and overall well-being. The Easterlin Paradox [easterlin1974] holds that, beyond a certain level of economic development, additional national income does not improve national happiness. Since then, several studies have examined the relationship further, with the weight of evidence that even wealthier countries see happiness gains from additional economic growth. Following is a summary of select studies.",
