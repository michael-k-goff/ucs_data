This supports a commercial satellite market worth $2.5 billion in 2019 and projected to grow to $4.7 billion in 2025 [comsatval]."

Microwave and laser thermal rockets are appealing options because they separate the energy source from the rocket. A microwave thermal rocket could achieve launch costs to low earth orbit as low as $125/kg [microwave_launch]. However, substantial research and development is still needed, and microwave and laser thermal rockets would require highly capital intensive ground facilities [microwave_launch].",
			"A spaceplane, such as the single-stage-to-orbit Skylon plane current under development [skylon], is air-breathing, thus reducing the thrust-to-weight ratio relative to rockets. However, it is not likely to be competitive in the launch market [skylon_comparison].",
			"There are many proposals for launch megastructures that use electromagnetic or mechanical lift, such as the StarTram [startram], launch loop [launchloop], orbital ring [orbital_ring], space elevator [space_elevator], and skyhook [skyhook]. Each of these concepts relies on speculative engineering and is probably not a near term option.",
