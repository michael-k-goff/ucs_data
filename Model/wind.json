			"Although the wind industry is mature, there are several innovations under development that will likely further improve its performance.",

			"Several studies suggest that adding winglets to the tips of turbine blades would increase power output [winglet4][winglet3][winglet1], perhaps by 2-8% [winglet2]. Winglets would also reduce high-frequency noise [winglet_noise].",
			"New generator technologies have the potential to reduce costs. Two leading candidates are superconducting drivetrains and pseudo direct drive generators based on permanent magnets, though cost reductions in superconducting material are needed for the former to be feasible [drivetrain]. Potential advantages of a superconducting drivetrain include reduced generator weight [drivetrain2] and reduced reliance on potentially scarce dysprosium [dysprosium].",
			"<b>High-Altitude Wind</b>",
			"A high-altitude wind turbine, flown with a kite, would access the less intermittent jetstream wind source and could further reduce intermittency by adjusting altitude [archer_caldeira]. Miller, Gans, and Kleidon [jetstream75] estimate that the jetstream potential resource is 7.5 TW, less than half of world energy use, and harvesting all of it would cause climate disruption, whereas Archer and Caldeira [archer_caldeira] estimate that high-altitude wind could supply all the world's energy needs without climate impact. The risk of an accident is also uncertain.",
			"We estimate the cost of a high-altitude wind research program to be about $22 billion and the expected benefit $21 billion. As the technology is far from commercialization, we estimate the time for such a program is 25 years [sofge], at the same $830 million annual cost as a proposed <a href=\"/solution/energy/mhk\">wave energy</a> research program. The potential cost is estimated to be as low as 2.5 &cent;/kWh [highalt_lcoe]. We assume that high-altitude wind has the same greehounse gas and non-GHG impacts as conventional wind, except a zero visual disamenity cost is assumed. For the purposes of this calculation, we assume the more expansive resource availability of Archer and Caldeira. See our analysis of <a href=\"/solution/energy/rd\">research and development</a> for more information.",
			"While the expected cost and benefit of high-altitude wind are approximately equal, both are highly uncertain. These estimates would benefit greatly from more research into the resource potential in particular."
