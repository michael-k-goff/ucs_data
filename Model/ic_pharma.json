			"Bioprospecting is the practice of searching for pharmaceutical or other products among wild plants and animals. It has been proposed as a mechanism for funding conservation. In biodiversity hotspots, the value of nature from bioprospecting has been estimated at $21 [bioprospecting] to $9177 [rausser_small] per hectare. About 25% (range of 14-40%) of modern pharmaceuticals can be traced to wild sources [costello_ward].",
