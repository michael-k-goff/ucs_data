The United States, along with many other countries [mckinsey_world_housing], faces a housing affordability challenge.",

			"!Housing affordability in the United States as of 2017, as measured by share of pre-tax income spent on housing. Households that spend 30-50%, and more than 50%, on housing are considered to be cost-burdened and severely cost-burdened respectively by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

			"On a per-area basis, housing in the United States is especially cheap; this is partially made up for with <a href=\"/solution/cities/cities_trends\">larger homes</a> [const_physics].",
			"In most high-income countries, housing, expressed as a share of income, has gotten more expensive since 2000 [oecd_hous_aff], and as of 2021, the housing price to income ratio is close to the value of the previous peak in 2007 [oecd_housing].",
			"Cities should address all of these challenges by revising the <a href=\"/solution/cities/cities_taxes\">financial incentives</a> that incentivize low density develop and the <a href=\"/solution/cities/cities_zoning\">zoning restrictions</a> that prevent high density development."

		"content":[
			"The construction of new housing, especially market-rate housing, can be controversial in part due to the fear that, since the price of the new housing is typically above average for the city, poorer residents will not benefit. However, even if poorer residents don't move into the new housing themselves, they may move into the units vacated by people moving into the new housing, or into units vacated by people moving into units vacated by people moving into the new housing, and so on. This effect is known as filtering.",
			"Evidence from Helsinki, Finland [filtering_helsinki] and the United States [us_filtering] suggests that filtering does occur, and new housing disproportionately benefits people of lower incomes."
