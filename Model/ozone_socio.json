			"The depletion of stratospheric ozone, driven primarily by the presence of chlorine and bromine in the stratosphere, is a significant health risk to human and animal life. The ozone layer has started to recover following the Montreal Protocol of 1987 [ozonewatch], which banned many ozone-depleting substances, but full recovery is not expected until around 2070 [ozone2018].",

			"As of 2016, world emissions of ozone-depleting substances are estimated as follows. Evidence suggests the unreported increase in CFC-11 emissions, which is illegal under the Montreal Protocol, is coming from Eastern China [china_cfc].",

			"!Major ozone-depleting chemicals and estimated depletion potential from emissions as of 2016 as reported by the Goddard Center [ozonewatch], and major sources of emissions as reported by the World Meteorological Association [ozone2018]. Not every ozone-depleting chemical is listed.",
			"Based on a social cost of CFC-11 of $618/kg (2020 dollars) reported in 1992 [cfc_cost], current world ozone-depleting emissions from human activity inflict $86-199 billion of damages per year. Separately, the Montreal Protocol has been estimated to prevent $51 billion (2020 dollars) in damages per year from 1987 to 2060 to human health, agriculture, fisheries, and materials [montreal]."
