			"An enhanced geothermal system (EGS) extracts heat from deep within the Earth and in environments that are not naturally porous. Unlike traditional hydrothermal geothermal energy, EGS resources are accessible from almost everywhere on Earth, though at varying cost and difficulty. Medium-grade EGS resources are widespread throughout the Western United States and available in other parts of the country, while low-grade resources are available almost everywhere [beckers]. Estimated EGS reserves are 266,000 EJ [tester], over 400 years of world primary energy consumption.",

NREL [nrel_resource] estimates the cost for district heating, which is higher since not all extracted heat in a district system would be useful [reber].",
			"Even at a higher price, EGS for district heating should be competitive with natural gas prices observed since 2005 [gas_price]. Further cost reductions may be possible through combined district heating and cooling systems [rogowska].",

			"@Enhanced Geothermal Research and Development@We estimate the expected benefit of enhanced geothermal research to be about $48 billion and the cost about $8 billion. The cost assumes 10 years of further research, at an annual cost the same as a <a href=\"/solution/energy/mhk\">wave energy</a> program of $830 million per year. The final price of enhanced geothermal power is estimated at 6 &cent;/kWh, with the same life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and other externalities as other forms of geothermal power. See our analysis of <a href=\"/solution/energy/rd\">research and development</a> for more information.@The benefit of research may be greater if the resulting enhanced geothermal energy is also be used for direct heat.@Research priorities include better characterization of the subsurface heat map, better drill bits, and more usage of supercritical fluids [dourado_geothermal]."
