Major pollutants from coal power are sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrous oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>), particulate matter, and heavy metals, particularly mercury, each of which causes serious health damage to humans and economic damages. The damages are estimated at 1.27-1.84 &cent;/kWh [samadi], though vary widely due to differences in pollution controls [nrc_external]. Enhanced pollution controls should lower damages in the future. Epstein's mean estimate of 18.8 &cent;/kWh [coal_externality] of all coal damages is higher than most others. Coal transportation damages are given by Hein and Howard [coal_external]. Coal mining, particularly mountaintop removal, cause significant additional ecological impact. Unquantified are external costs associated with coal ash disposal."

Since the Clean Air Act of 1970, coal plants have installed flue gas desulphurization (scrubbers) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). These technologies have produced a cost to efficiency of 2% and 1% respectively [npc_efficiency].  The expansion of these technologies over time will nevertheless reduce the health and air pollution impact of coal on a per-kWh basis.

The costs of capturing CO<sub>2</sub> are estimated from $35 to $95 per ton [gillingham][hardisty][hu][rubin]. Moreover, the reduction in efficiency means that more coal is required to produce each kilowatt-hour for the broader economy, raising the non-greenhouse gas costs of coal combustion. This efficiency penalty has been estimated at 12-23 percentage-points [supekar]."
