			"Antibiotics are one of the great achievements of modern medicine, with an estimated value of $60-300 trillion in the United States alone [amr_us]. However, this value depletes with usage, since antibiotic usages causes bacteria to evolve with antibiotic resistance. Under current trends, antibiotic resistant bacteria could kill 10 million people per year and lower GDP by 2-3.5% by 2050 [amr_review]. Heavy use of antibiotics in livestock is of particular concern.",

			"The connection between farm antibiotic usage and antibiotic resistance infections in humans is firmly established [farm_amr], though the marginal impact of antibiotic usage is not known with precision. It is estimated that as of 1999, the fluoroquinolone resistance of a specific pathogen, <i>Campylobacter</i>, was responsible for 7 cents of externalized damage per chicken produced [amr_chicken], in contrast to a wholesale price of about $2 of meat per chicken. Since then, fluoroquinolone has been effectively banned in chicken production.",

This phenomenon has been observed, for example, in the context of rice [monoculture_risk1], forestry [monoculture_risk2], and biofuels [monoculture_risk3]. Historically, increased vulnerability to disease resulting from monoculture production contributed to the blight behind the Irish Potato Famine [potato_famine] and the Panama Disease outbreak that devastated Gros Michel banana crops in the 1950s [panama_disease]."
