			"!Select estimates of the social cost of carbon, assessed per ton of CO<sub>2</sub>, 2019 USD. Sources: Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon [social_cost_carbon], Moore and Diaz [stanford_scc], Nordhaus [scc_nordhaus], and Wang et al. [scc_meta]. A major source of variation in SCC estimates is the discount rate, or the extent to which future economic damage should be valued less than present costs. Rennert and Kingdon [rennert] illustrate how an SCC estimate can vary by discount rate.",
			"Major damages in climate economic modeling include rising sea level, severe weather, wider range of tropical disease, direct impact of heat, and increased cooling costs. Models generally take into account the benefits of lower heating costs and CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization of crops [scc_cat]. Most countries will be harmed by climate change, with India hit particularly hard, though Russia, Canada, and Scandinavian countries could benefit [scc_country].",
			"Throughout Urban Cruise Ship, unless stated otherwise, we use a social cost of carbon of $50/ton CO<sub>2</sub>e. This translates to 45 &cent;/gallon for gasoline [eia_gas]."
