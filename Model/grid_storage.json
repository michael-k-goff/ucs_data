			"<b>Pumped Hydro</b>",
			"Although pumped hydro is established, there are novel hyrdo concepts under development. Coastal sites may be able to use the ocean as a reservoir. Variable-speed pumped hydro might be of greater value than conventional pumped hydro due to a greater ability to provide ancillary services [bulk_storage].",

			"<b>Capacitors</b>",
			"Capacitors are an important tool for regulating grid voltage levels, but until recently they have not been regarded as feasible for large-scale energy storage. Next-generation capacitors, known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, can react more quickly than other storage media, smooth out sudden voltage changes, and thereby extend the life of batteries by 10-30% [hales]. Multi-hour energy storage may be achievable at 5 &cent;/kWh per cycle [jme_capacitors].",
			"<b>Vehicles as Storage</b>",
			"Vehicles could be used for energy storage. Electric or fuel-cell vehicles are estimated to be available at $400 for a 6.6 kW system.  Then parked cars would be suitable for supplying the grid, even playing a role as baseload power [tmv2g]. The economic case for vehicle to grid technology remains unclear [cav2g]. Hydrogen for energy storage could work synergistically with hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, since a price signal could induce drivers to fill up when excess grid-produced hydrogen is cheap [berry_storage].",
			"<b>Nuclear Batteries</b>",
			"Betavoltaics, also called nuclear batteries, are a useful source of energy for niche applications. A recently developed Nickel-63 battery achieved 3300 mWh/g energy density, about 10 times that of chemical batteries. However, the power density--10 μW/cm3--make the battery suitable only for applications such as medical devices and spacecraft [betavoltaic]. The limitation in power density is likely to be unavoidable [betavoltaic2]."
