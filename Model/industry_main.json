Emissions can be reduced through more aggressive efficiency and technology efforts, such as in commodities and <a href=\"/solution/energy/industrial_systems\">motor and steam systems</a>, <a href=\"/solution/energy/recycling\">recycling</a>, and <a href=\"/solution/energy/material_reduction\">material reduction</a>, but the greatest near term potential might lie in <a href=\"/solution/energy/ccs\">carbon capture and sequestration</a>. However, CCS necessarily requires policy support, such as carbon pricing or regulation. The solutions with the largest potential impacts--CCS and electricity or hydrogen for <a href=\"/solution/energy/industrial_heat\">industrial heat</a>--come at substantial energy costs and will require additional development of clean energy sources."
