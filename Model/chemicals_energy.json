[saygin], with the IEA Sankey diagram [iea_sankey] used to estimate primary energy savings. Savings potential from plastics recycling is estimated by taking savings per ton, given by Hopewell et al. [plastic_recycling], and applying to total plastics usage worldwide, given by PlasticsEurope [plasticseurope], minus the portion already recycling, estimated by the IEA [futureofpetrochemicals].",

However, electrolysis can reduce greenhouse gas emissions only if the electricity is generated from a low carbon source [futureofpetrochemicals]. The electrolysis route for the chemical industry is technically possible but economically infeasible at present.",
