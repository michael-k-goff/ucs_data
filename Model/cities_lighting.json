			"The advent of LED lighting is a major driver of energy efficiency. While the lighting market is transitioning to LEDs on its own, public support to accelerate the transition could save over 1.4 EJ of primary energy per year by 2030 [led_forecast]. Replacing all outdoor parking, roadway, and highway lighting with LEDs would save about 0.4 EJ of primary energy [outdoor_led].",
			"Household and commercial building appliances, such as refrigerators, dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers, and microwaves, typically improve in energy efficiency by about 4% per year [us_appliance_trend][eu_appliance_trend]. Continuing to invest in appliance efficiency should save the United States about 1.6 EJ of primary energy per year by 2040."
