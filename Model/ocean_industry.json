			"When offshore oil rigs reach the end of their oil production, they can be appropriated for other uses, creating an offshore industrial space at low marginal cost. In an environmental impact statement, the Minerals Management Services of the U. S. Department of the Interior identified ocean energy production, aquaculture, and research and monitoring as among industrial uses for old oil rigs [oil_rig_eis]."

			"Access to abundant, low-cost energy is a major factor in the success of energy-intensive industries [aluminum_energy]. Iceland is a leader in aluminum smelting [iceland_alum1] and metal smelting in general [iceland_alum2], for instance, in major part due to cheap geothermal power and hydroelectricity. Australia is developing an ammonia export terminal because local solar energy is cheap and exceeds local needs [aus_ammonia].",
