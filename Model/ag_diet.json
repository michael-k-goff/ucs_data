Caloric intake figures are taken from FAOSTAT [faostat]. Land use figures are taken from FAOSTAT [faostat] for crops, from Clark and Tilman for terrestrial meat and animal products [meat_land_use], and from Froehlich et al. [aq_land_use] for seafood. Crop land use is based on world average yield. Land use estimates for animal products is based on an average of life cycle analysis studies, and due to bias in data availability, the studies may skew toward wealthier countries. Land use estimates for seafood is taken to be the land requires to grow crops to provide feed for aquaculture, assuming the feed mix in U. S. freshwater aquaculture. The ocean area swept by trawl fishing for wild catch seafood is considerable but not included above. The figures may be underestimates in that land use requirements for the following items are not included due to data limitations: alcoholic bevarages, offal, animal fat, aquatic plants, infant food, marine mammals, and uncatagorized products. These items constitute about 5% of world average caloric intake.",

The low calorie diet is assumed to be the same as the average American diet, but with a 25% across-the-board calorie reduction. Under the pescetarian diet, all terrestrial meat is replaced by seafood. Under the vegetarian diet, all meat is replaced by non-meat food in proportions equal to consumption under the American diet. Under the vegan diet, all meat and animal products are replaced by non-animal food in proportions equal to consumption under the American diet, and an additional 100 calories of nuts and seeds are assumed. For all diets, land requirements per food item are the same as above.",
