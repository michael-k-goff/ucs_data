Impacts of wheat and soy are given by Clark and Tilman [meat_land_use]. Bogdahn reports the <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> route's estimated energy need. Linder reports 1 gram of methanol is needed to produce 0.52 grams of dry mass from <i>Methylophilus methylotrophus</i>; the energy input is based on the energy density and electricity-to-methanol conversion efficiency given by Dana et al. [dana]. Figures do not include energy embodied in equipment or other potentially needed inputs, such as ammonia and trace nutrients. Greenhouse gas estimates for the bacteria routes are those of the energy inputs, with carbon intensity reported by the IPCC [ipcc_ghg]. Land use figures for the bacteria routes are those of the energy inputs as given by van Zalk and Behrens [vanzalk], plus an additional 0.0018 m<sup>2</sup>/kg for the facilities themselves, as given by Linder but applied to both bacteria routes.",
