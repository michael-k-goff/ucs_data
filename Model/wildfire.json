			"Fire suppression is the practice of aggressively suppressing wildfires. While fire suppression can prevent fire in the short term, the practice disrupts natural ecological cycles--of which fire is a part--and leads to an accumulation of biomass which increases the future fire risk. Fire suppression has been identified as a contributing factor to increasing intensity of Western wildfires since the 1980s [suppression1][suppression3][suppression2].",
