			"Like ethanol, methanol can be blended into the gasoline supply, with a maximum ratio of about 10% without requiring modification of engines of internal combustion vehicles [methanol_blending]. Furthermore, methanol and ethanol can be blended independently, forming gasoline-ethanol-methanol (GEM) fuels. Methanol blending into gasoline has become common in several countries, particularly China, where M15 (15% methanol blend) constituted 23% of all gasoline sold in the country in 2013 [china_meoh].",

Financial costs of adding methanol are based on the median value ($280/ton) of methanol from natural gas without carbon capture and sequestration.      @<span style=\"font-size:17px;\"><b>Benefit Calculations: </b></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Financial benefits of displacing gasoline are based on the average wholesale gasoline price in 2019 [wholesale_gas2021]. Emissions of gasoline and methanol are as detailed above. Much greater emissions reductions are possible if methanol is produced from low-carbon processes.        @These figures do not account for pollution costs beyond greenhouse gases. Methanol blending results in a decrease in carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions, and an increase in NOx emissions [meoh_pollution]. If made from local energy sources, methanol blending would also bring an unquantified benefit in energy security.        @<span style=\"font-size:17px;\"><b>Implementation:</b></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Federal legislation, similar to the current mandate to blend ethanol into the gasoline supply [ethanol_regs], is one way the goal could be accomplished.      @Experience in Shaanxi Province, China, where M15 has become common, shows that recently manufactured cars should be able to use M15 without modification, though some old storage tanks and other infrastructure may need to be upgraded to handle the slightly more corrosive mix [mi_overview].      @Methanol is highly toxic to humans and can cause blindness and death, though is not more toxic than gasoline. When spilled, methanol biodegrades faster than gasoline or diesel and generally causes less environmental damage [meoh_safety].       @<span style=\"font-size:17px;\"><b>Credits: </b></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; We would like to thank Chris Chatterton of the Methanol Institute for helpful discussions and for directing us toward valuable resources.",
			"@Replacing Gasoline with Methanol@For high methanol blends, as high as M-100 (100% methanol fuel), it is necessary to upgrade the engines of automobiles to use them, similar to flex-fuel engines for high ethanol blends. The cost of doing so, CP-adjusted to 2020, is estimated from [meoh_upgrade].
