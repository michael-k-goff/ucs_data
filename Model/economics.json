			"Energy plays an important role in long-term economic growth. Ayres and Warr [ayres_warr] demonstrated that, as of 1998 (their last year of data), a 1% increase in available exergy (the capacity of energy to do useful work), correlates with a nearly 0.7% increase in GDP. It is not clear, however, whether exergy drives economic growth, or whether economic growth drives an increase in exergy, or both. Stern argues [stern] that, up to a point, energy is a strong constraint on economic growth. Beyond that point, an expansion of the energy supply does not generate much more growth."
