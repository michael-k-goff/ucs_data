Zoning is a major contributor in high housing costs [glaeser_gyourko2002], and by preventing people from being able to move to highly productive cities, zoning restrictions are estimated to cost the American economy from $400 billion to $1.7 trillion per year [glaeser_gyourko][golden_state][hm2017].",

In some cases there may be justification for retaining the rules, such as management of traffic [far_traffic], but cities should periodically reanalyze their rules."

The rules are a <b>minimum lot requirement</b> of half an acre for single family homes, when otherwise a median lot would be used; a <b>parking minimum</b> that requires 0.5 more parking spaces per unit than necessary for a walk-up apartment; a <b>minimum unit size</b> that causes a building of studio apartments to be built instead of an single room occupancy building; and a <b>height limit</b> that requires a six story apartment building when the market would otherwise supply 12 stories. For the latter three scenarios, all people displaced by zoning instead live in median lot detached homes. Source and calculation details are below."
