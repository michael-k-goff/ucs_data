Benefits include the financial savings of displacing more expensive electricity, greenhouse gas benefits (valued at $50/ton), and non-GHG external benefits of electricity.

			"!For R&D time, we assume 5 years for technologies that are commercially deployed today but not at full potential, 10 years for those near but not at commercialization, 25 years for those not near commercialization, and 40 years for fusion and space-based solar. We assume a 4.9% chance of an R&D program being successful, based on a similar study in the pharmaceutical industry [rd_success].",
			"!For R&D cost, we assume $460 million per year for nuclear technologies, based on an analysis of advanced reactors [nuclear_future]; $830 million per year for renewables, based on a wave energy analysis [re_vision]; and $65 billion total for fusion and space-based solar, based on an analysis of ITER [iter_cost].",

A balanced research program by the Department of Energy will consist of full funding for the national laboratories, ARPA-E for high-risk, high-reward projects, the Energy Frontier Research Centers for basic science, energy innovation hubs for collaboration with industry, and the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation for advances based on manufacturing capacity [doe_rd]."
