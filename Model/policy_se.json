			"The benefits of new plants includes possibly cheaper electricity, reduction of greenhouse gases and other pollution, and the cost reduction of similar future technology through learning-by-doing. No learning-by-doing effect for nuclear power was identified in the literature; hence the cost/benefit ratio of that technology is rather poor.",
