[krausmann2009], CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from Le Quéré et al.[carbon_budget], air pollution in the OECD from the OECD [oecd_air], access to clean water from Ritchie and Roser [water_access], extreme poverty rates from Roser and Ortiz-Ospina [extreme_poverty], methane from the World Bank [wb_methane], ozone-depleting emissions from the World Meteorological Organization [ozone2018], water withdrawal from Worldometer [worldometer], and mercury emissions from Zhang et al.
