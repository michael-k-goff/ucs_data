Grid operators purchase electricity from power plants on the wholesale market, while end-use customers purchase electricity from the grid through utilities in the retail market. In the United States, the wholesale price of electricity <a href=\"http://callmepower.com/faq/electricity-prices/difference-wholesale-retail\">comprises only 35%</a> of a typical customer's bill, while delivery costs are 45%.
