Most heating and cooling energy can be saved through better equipment, compact buildings with shared walls, and more efficient energy sources such as a district heating and cooling system. Thus the challenge of efficient heating and cooling is both a matter of better heating and cooling technology as well as <a href=\"/solution/cities/cities_density\">urban density</a>."

For electricity-based heating sources, emissions factors and primary energy are based on the average US electricity mix in 2018. The energy and environmental performance of a district heating system is highly dependent on the energy source. The primary energy estimate for district heating is based on European Union standards [lubinski] and the greenhouse gas estimate from world performance [dhc_overview].",

			"Sweden is a world leader in the use of district heating, which provides over 50% of the country's residential and commercial heating needs [sweden_dhc]. Only 3% of heating demand was met by district systems in 1960 [sweden_dhc], but in the following decades, the Swedish government saw district heating as a solution to achieve several goals--reduce dependence on oil, spur the construction of new homes, and reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions--and invested accordingly [sweden_dhc].",
			"From 1980 to 2015, the carbon intensity of Sweden's district heating fell from about 325 grams CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent per megajoule to 65 grams/MJ [data_parks], driven in part by the country's high carbon tax, as coal and oil have been replaced by biomass, waste, combined heat and power systems, and excess industrial heat [sweden_dhc].",
			"Today, Stockholm is developing the Open District Heating concept, which would create a market for smaller heat providers, such as data centers, to sell heat in the district system [data_parks]. In recent years, Sweden has conducted pilot projects into using district heating for washing machines and dishwashers [sweden_dhc]. As of 2014, district cooling systems delivered 3.6 petajoules, and this figure is growing at 8% per year [sweden_dhc]."
