			"-img2019_06_11_elec_external.jpg-60",
			"!Most costs measured are air pollution damages, both at the power plant and from upstream processes. Figures also include an estimated visual disamenity cost for wind power of 0.68 &cent;/kWh (onshore) and 0.27 &cent;/kWh (offshore), as well as a 0.54 &cent;/kWh cost resulting from the risk of nuclear accidents--both of which are highly debated. Costs are generally highly variable, depending on factors such as the location of the plant and pollution controls. Sources: [externe][grausz][samadi].",

			"!Generally, biomass and hydropower are the most land-intensive, though with variation depending on how biomass is sourced, and fossil fuels and nuclear are the most compact. Note that hydroelectric dams often have multiple functions, such as irrigation and flood control, and consequently land use figures might not be directly comparable to plants that are strictly for power production. The value for Wind power assesses the full landscape land use; the direct footprint is much lower and is compatible with other uses. Sources: Geothermal and solar thermal from [trainor], transmission from [strata_landuse], and others from [vanzalk].",

			"!With the except of hydropower, most water is used for thermal cooling, and thus non-thermal plants generally have low water needs. Note that the hydropower figures are not necessarily directly comparable to other power sources, due to the secondary uses of dams for such purposes as irrigation and flood control. Estimates on water intensity of thermal generation and hydropower are taken from Tidwell and Moreland [tidwell], while estimates of the water intensity of wind and solar, and of fuel preparation, are from Spang et al.
