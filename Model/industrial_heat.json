However, EGS requires advanced drilling technology and is <a href=\"/solution/energy/geothermal\">still under development</a>. EGS is more likely to be valuable as a source of direct heat. A study of the Habanero EGS project at Cooper Basin in Australia found that it could produce heat that would be competitive with natural gas at $6.50 to $8.20 per GJ. Thus direct heat production should be economically competitive, even though electricity production is not, from the Habanero site [egs_heat]."
