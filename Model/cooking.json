The resulting indoor air pollution is estimated to kill at least 370,000 to 500,000 people per year [cookstoves1], and as many as 3-4 million [cookstoves2]. We estimate the following impacts of cooking fuel.",

Differences are due to differences in how fuel is procured and household size. These figures are total emissions and obscure the fact that, in the case of electric stoves, emissions are primarily at the power plant instead of the stovetop. Source: [cookstoves3].",

Individuals who use natural gas stoves tend to be exposed to greater air pollution as a result [cookstoves4]. Electric ovens tend to be safer, more convenient, but have a longer heating time [cookstoves5]. Electric ovens are comparatively better for preparing crisp, dry food, while gas ovens are better with moist food [cookstoves5].",
