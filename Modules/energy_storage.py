# A summary of energy storage venues.

# For each one, there is the cost, in terms of electricity that must be invested.
#   Would need a model of the electricity mix to be applied
# Benefit: displaced fuel from elsewhere
# Enablement of renewable energy

# Forms of energy storage to consider:

# Algae-based biofuels
# Hydrogen
# Ammonia
# Methanol
# Synfuels
# Methanol
# Grid batteries

# Probably consider separately by use. E.g. hydrogen for aviation synfuels, rather than just hydrogen
