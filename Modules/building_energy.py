    "details":"The estimated cost of this endeavor is $500,000 to $3 million over 10 years, based on the cost of Spawn development. Use the larger value if you can't show a range. For benefit, we'll estimate $1 billion over 10 years. Savings is estimated to be 1% of the share of heating and cooling energy savings potential (determined by the IEA) for the United States (apportioned from North America). The savings is based on the value of the heating and cooling energy, assuming it is all natural gas (gas tends to have a lower price per unit energy than other sources). Savings turned out to be $1.04 billion, which is rounded down to $1B.",
