The IPCC summary defines the scenarios (which are named after the radiative forcing in 2100) and reports estimated warming and sea level rise. Lafakis et al. give the numbers for atmospheric CO2 concentration. Several references are noted in the table for the impact on GDP. For the Kompas et al. figures, they report GDP impacts in terms of 2C, 3C, and 4C scenarios, which I am mapping onto the RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 scenarios respectively, but that's not perfect. Crop yield figures are from Wiebe et al. They do not account for CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization effects and thus might be pessimistic. Their study aggregates estimates for coarse grains, rice, wheat, oilseeds and sugar crops. It is possible we might add more data, such as additional results on economic or crop yield impact, severity on flooding or natural disasters, or biodiversity impacts, but this should be enough for now. Consider breaking this into multiple plots if appropriate.",
