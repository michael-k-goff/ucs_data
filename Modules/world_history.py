    "details":"A few changes to be made. Look at the chart closely, as some events have been added, removed, or renamed. Some general comments. The projection lines were good; I would be careful about having them intersect text. Maybe add the lines but break them for text. For every timeline exceppt the Near Future, the first event on one timeline should also appear on the previous timeline. The words for time lengths (e.g. 'billions' on the first one) should be closer to the actual numbers. For the events with date ranges, like the world wars, either portray them as ranges on the image or indicate that the shown date is the starting date. A note about eras:<br><br>Rename \"Evolution of Animals Timeline\" to \"Animals Timeline\". The end date of this timeline should go to the likely extinction of animals, about 900 million years from now.<br><br>To be clearer on the name, and also a bit more accurate, Chalcolithic (Copper Age) has been renamed Bronze Age. The period corresponds more closely with the Bronze Age anyway. The dates on the Bronze Age should be 3500 BC to AD 1760 (this includes the Iron Age and subsequent eras, which don't have their own timeline). It should be noted that the dates of the Bronze Age vary considerably by region; I am choosing a start date corresponding with the Near East Bronze Age, which is the earliest widely accepted time that it started.<br><br>I am choosing the invention of the James Watt steam engine as the start of the Industrial Revolution. Dates range from the invention of the Newcomen steam engine (1712) to the commercialization of railroads (1820s).<br><br>There are more recent events, so let's go back to splitting the recent era into Atomic (~1945-1990) and Information (~1990 to present)<br><br>For the near future material, emphasize that these are predictions from practioners in the field, not necessarily our predictions.",
